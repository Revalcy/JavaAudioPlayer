## Notes

- This project uses the Java Sound API to play audio files.  
- Audio playback requires a machine with a sound device.  
- Running this project in a headless environment (e.g., GitHub Codespaces, cloud IDEs) may cause audio errors, but the code logic will still function correctly.  
- To test audio, run the project locally on your computer with a WAV file placed in the project root.
